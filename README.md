# Assessment

It is expected by the app we have a user "postgres" with a password "admin".
Next, we need to create a database in the postgres shell:
```shell
CREATE DATABASE assessment;
```
Then, get the dependencies and launch the server

```shell
npm i
npm run index.js
```

Run test in another instance

```shell
npm run test.js
```
